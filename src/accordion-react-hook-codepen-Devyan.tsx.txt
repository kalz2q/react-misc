 /*   
  When we declare a state variable with useState, 
  it returns a pair — an array with two items. 
  The first item is the current value, 
  and the second is a function that lets us update it.
  
  useState also called state hook
  it lets us add local state to React function components
  
  Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React features from function components
  Their names always start with use
